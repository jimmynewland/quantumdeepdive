The most obvious difference is that the Qubit class has been replaced by a Photon class.  Photons have similar **prepare** and **measure** methods as Qubits but take optional arguments.\n","\n","The **prepare** method takes the optional argument **avgPhotonNumber**, which defines the intensity of Alice's light.  The default value is 1.0.  Higher values give Bob a better chance of detection but result in more multiple detections.\n","\n","The **measure** method gives four possible outcomes instead of just two.  The additional two outcomes are \"N\" (no detections) and \"M\" (multiple detections).  Measurements are implemented with a polarizing beam splitter and two single-photon detectors.  If neither detector \"clicks\" an \"N\" outcome results.  If both detectors click an \"M\" outcome results.  A valid measurement is one in which only one of the two detectors clicks, indicating an \"H\" or \"V\" outcome (for **measureHV**) or a \"D\" or \"A\" outcome (for **measureDA**).\n","\n","The **measure** method takes the optional argument **probDarkCount**, which defines the sensivity of Bob's detectors.  The default value is 0.1 (or 10%).  Higher values give fewer \"N\" outcomes but more dark counts.  Lower values give more \"N\" outcomes but fewer dark counts.  Dark counts are indistinguishable from valid detections but will result in greater mismatch between Alice and Bob's final one-time pads.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UH7WFlNWHa5c"},"source":["# The Photon Class\n","\n","The cell below defines the **photon** class used in this notebook.
